# The Meme Matching Game

This game is a test of memory where one must flip cards to find matches from the array of cards.

# Getting started

The inspiration for this game came from the basic matching games that we all know. My personal mark on the project though was the theme, which I enjoyed curating. The images came from my own folder of personal meme's that I find to express my feelings when I have no words. It is my hope that as you play you find a similar joy in meme's as I have.

## Personal Experience
Working through this project I have realized I need to engage more with the resources provided. My attempts to conquer this alone gave me a mass of knowledge that I found incredibly difficult to string together into an efficient product.
